.. CHANGELOG HOWTO.

   To add an entry to the changelog, create a file named
   <timestamp>_<subject>.rst inside the ase/changelog.d/ directory.
   Timestamp should be at least YYYYMMDD.

   You can also install scriv (https://pypi.org/project/scriv/) and run
   "scriv create" to do this automatically, if you do this often.

   Edit the file following a similar style to other changelog entries and
   try to choose an existing section for the release note.

   For example ase/changelog.d/20250108_amber_fix_velocities.rst with contents:

     Calculators
     -----------

     - Amber: Fix scaling of velocities in restart files (:mr:`3427`)

   For each release we generate a full changelog which is inserted below.

Version 3.28.0
==============

I/O
---

- Accelerate :func:`~ase.io.lammpsrun.read_lammps_dump_text`
  using a NumPy structured array (:mr:`3939`)

- Accelerate :func:`~ase.io.lammpsrun.read_lammps_dump_text` and
  :func:`~ase.io.lammpsrun.read_lammps_dump_binary` by parsing the data file
  only for necessary frames (:mr:`3959`, :mr:`3972`)

- Improvements to elk-in writer: (:mr:`3950`)
  - add the string parameter type
  - parameters: top-level tuple to describe an input block
  - nested tuples to describe the multi-key inputs within a line
  - remove partial inconsistent ase->elk units conversion

- Modified :func:`~ase.io.vasp.write_vasp_xdatcar` to print the header,
  including the cell, for every image (:mr:`2873`)

- Fixed a bug in CASTEP .phonon file reader: q-points beyond the first were not loaded. (:mr:`3977`)

  - Added missing unit tests for CASTEP .phonon reader

- Add writers for MDL Molfile V2000 based MOL and SDF formats. (:mr:`4008`)

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Changes have been made to
  :func:`ase.visualize.plot.plot_atoms`. These are intended to "do the
  right thing" and streamline common usage especially in tutorial
  material.  (:mr:`3979`)

  - always remove axis decorations to give a cleaner output.

  - If no existing Axes are provided, create a new Figure. (Existing
    behaviour is to work on the "current" Axes, possibly overwriting
    an unrelated plot.)

- A lower-level function :func:`ase.visualize.plot.plot_atoms_raw` is
  provided which simply plots to a provided Matplotlib Axes; other
  formatting is left to the user. This is recommended for use in
  composite figures where the default/fixed behaviours of
  :func:`~ase.visualize.plot.plot_atoms` are unweildy.

Calculators
-----------

- Added ``with_tags`` parameter to :class:`~ase.calculators.dftb.Dftb` calculator to enable using atom tags to distinguish between chemically identical species. This allows different Slater-Koster parameter sets for atoms with the same element but different tags. (:mr:`3702`)

Optimizers
----------

- Change the default method for :class:`~ase.mep.neb.NEB` to ``'improvedtangent'`` (previously ``'aseneb'``).

- For compatibility with older code, re-add ``opt.converged()``
  as a way to check convergence.
  (Note that ``opt.run()`` returns whether it converged or not,
  and ``opt.irun()`` yields for each step whether it converged or not.)
  (:mr:`3990`)

Molecular dynamics
------------------

- Add :class:`~ase.md.MaskedMTKNPT` for cell fluctuation along specified axes.
  This can be used to perform *NPzT* ensemble MD simulations. (:mr:`3807`)

- Bug fix in Bussi dynamics: Would crash with GPAW calculator due to
  random number not being properly synchronized.  (:mr:`3976`)

- Deprecate ``fixcm=True`` in :class:`~ase.md.Langevin` because its
  implementation does not strictly sample the correct NVT distribution.
  Use :class:`~ase.constraints.FixCom` instead (:mr:`3986`)

GUI
---

- Users can now specify default values for the movie box in the GUI, through their '~/.ase/gui.py' settings file.

- Move and Rotate modes no longer turn on if no atoms are selected.

- An indicator is added to the bottom right corner that shows that a movement mode is active. This indicator also includes a contextual hint about modifier keys.

- Rotation vectors are transformed to give a more intuitive pitch/yaw/roll experience in rotate mode which is also consistent with mouse movements.

- Number fields in the GUI can now do basic arithmetic using Python syntax.

- Default radii for atoms in ~/.ase/gui.py can now be specified as a
  dictionary. Both the list and dictionary syntaxes now support using
  atomic symbols as an alternative to atomic numbers.

Documentation
-------------

 - The updated :ref:`tutorials` based on sphinx-gallery are now the
   main tutorials.

- Move Partly occupied Wannier Functions tutorial to sphinx gallery

- Move Surface diffusion energy barriers using the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method to sphinx gallery.

- Moved periodic table plot from gallery/ to examples/gallery, using the sphinx_gallery style.

Other changes
-------------

- Calls to spglib adapted to support the
  `future change of error handling
  <https://spglib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/autodoc/spglib.error.html>`__
  in spglib 2.8+. (:mr:`3948`)

- Deprecate :meth:`ase.geometry.analysis.Analysis.get_rdf` due to bugs when
  ``elements`` is not ``None``. This method will be removed soon.
  Use :func:`ase.geometry.rdf.get_rdf` instead (:mr:`3993`)

- Change :func:`ase.geometry.rdf.get_rdf` so that ``elements`` can accept
  chemical symbols (:mr:`3993`)

Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed :meth:`ase.optimize.optimize.Optimizer.todict` to return :py:obj:`None`
  for ``restart`` when not set (:mr:`3923`)

- Ctrl/Shift key handling is refactored in the GUI to try and combat a bug where Num Lock would continuously register as a modifier. This was causing the arrow keys to behave incorrectly in "Move" and "Rotate" modes.

- Fixed :class:`~ase.spectrum.band_structure.BandStructure` legend plotting for figures with multiple axes (:mr:`3935`)
- Fixed :class:`~ase.spectrum.band_structure.BandStructure` to save the figure associated with the axes (:mr:`3935`)

- Make MolecularDynamics.run() return a boolean value. (:mr:`3938`)

- Fix :func:`~ase.io.lammpsrun.read_lammps_dump_text` and
  :func:`~ase.io.lammpsrun.read_lammps_dump_binary` to interpret ``index`` with
  negative ``start`` / ``stop`` / ``step`` correctly (:mr:`3959`, :mr:`3972`)

- Fixed :func:`~ase.io.vasp.read_vasp_xml` to get not the enthalpy but the
  energy without PV to be consistent with :func:`~ase.io.vasp.read_vasp_out`
  (:mr:`2685`)

- Fixed a bug where graphs could not be rendered when launching the GUI via IPython/Jupyter (:mr:`3945`)

- FHI-aims molecular calculations with spin collinear now have correct eigenvalue reading portions (:mr:`3951`)

- Setting the default radii for atoms in ~/.ase/gui.py works once again.

- Introduced checks to ensure no PBCs are used in Thermochemistry
  when calculating rotational moments of inertia. Also warn user
  if trying to use :func:`~ase.atoms.get_moments_of_inertia` when
  PBCs are present. (:mr:`3953`)

- Fix missing @writer decorator for :func:~ase.io.espresso.write_fortran_namelist` so can take str filenames (:mr:`4007`)

- Make vasp constraint reader which is called by outcar reader ignore empty
  CONTCAR/POSCAR files as well as non-existent ones (:mr:`4014`)

Version 3.27.0
==============


Thermochemistry
---------------

- Multiple changes to the :mod:`~ase.thermochemistry` module (:mr:`3358`):

  * **Breaking change**: The ``vib_energies`` property of thermochemistry classes is
    now deprecated. It will still be around for a while until all classes moved to
    the new modes-based framework. Adapt your workflows accordingly. See also below
    for more details on the new modes-based framework.

  * Major parts of the thermochemistry module have been rewritten to include
    a range of new methods: :class:`MSRRHOThermo` based on the modified
    rigid-rotor-harmonic-oscillator (msRRHO) approximation by Grimme *et al.*
    (:doi:`10.1002/chem.201200497` and :doi:`10.1039/D1SC00621E`) and Otlyotov
    and Minenkov :doi:`10.1002/jcc.27129`.
  * A new base class for thermochemistry, :class:`ase.thermochemistry.ThermoBase`,
    has been introduced to facilitate the implementation of new thermochemistry
    methods.
  * Multiple classes are now based on a framework of individual modes
    rather than just a list of vibrational energies. This allows for a
    flexible mixing of different treatments of vibrational modes
    (e.g., Grimme's msRRHO for low-frequency modes and harmonic
    oscillator for high-frequency modes). Each vibrational mode is
    represented by an instance of the
    :class:`ase.thermochemistry.AbstractMode` class or one of its
    subclasses. Multiple modes are then used to build a
    :class:`ase.thermochemistry.BaseThermoChem` instance or one of its
    subclasses. The old way of passing a list of vibrational energies is
    still supported for backwards compatibility, but it is recommended
    to switch to the new modes-based framework. The ``vib_energies``
    property is still available for backwards compatibility, but it is
    recommended to use the ``modes`` property instead, which returns a
    list of mode instances.


I/O
---

- Add support for reading Mulliken charges in
  :meth:`~ase.io.gamess_us.read_gamess_us_out` and
  :meth:`~ase.io.gamess_us.read_gamess_us_punch` (:mr:`3761`)

- Add support to parse general triclinic boxes in
  :meth:`~ase.io.lammpsdata.read_lammps_data`,
  :meth:`~ase.io.lammpsrun.read_lammps_dump_text`, and
  :meth:`~ase.io.lammpsrun.read_lammps_dump_binary` (:mr:`3797`)

- Add support for reading the energy and the dipole moment from "external" in
  :meth:`ase.io.gaussian.read_gausian_out` (:mr:`3801`)

- ASE now follows the EON convention for handling cell geometries.

- Update :meth:`~ase.io.lammpsdata.write_lammps_data` to parse atom types read
  by :meth:`~ase.io.lammpsdata.read_lammps_data` (:mr:`3847`)

- **Breaking** Trajectories and logfiles passed as filenames are not kept
  open during simulations.  Instead, the file is opened, written to
  (generally by appending), then closed again.  This improves IO safety
  and prevents resource leaks in many cases.  It is still possible to
  pass trajectories and logfiles that are already open, and then the
  caller is responsible for closing them.  Doing so may be beneficial
  in fast runs on slow file systems. (:mr:`3899`, :mr:`3930`)

- Updated :func:`~ase.io.lammpsdata.read_lammps_data` and
  :func:`~ase.io.lammpsdata.write_lammps_data` to parse ``Atom Type Labels``
  (:mr:`3916`)

Calculators
-----------

- Add LAMMPSlib features to support arbitrary startup flags (e.g.
  to enable kokkos) and arbitrary initialization callbacks (e.g.
  calling `lammps.mliap.activate_mliappy`)

- The `Vasp` calculator now has a more generic way of handling pseudopotentials. If the user specifies the `pp_version` keyword argument or equivalent `VASP_PP_VERSION` environment variable, the calculator will look for pseudopotentials in the corresponding VASP-provided pseudopotential directory. Simply download the pseudopotential folders provided by VASP and put them in one parent directory, defined by `VASP_PP_PATH`. If `pp_version` is `None` (default), the `Vasp` calculator will only look for `potpaw` (LDA) and `potpaw_PBE` (PBE) to maintain backwards compatability. If `pp_version="64"` (for instance), the calculator will look for pseudopotentials in the `potpaw.64` and `potpaw_PBE.64`, respectively.
- The `potpaw_GGA` (PW91) pseudpotential folder has been removed. This means setting `xc="PW91"` will no longer use the deprecated PW91 pseudopotential folder. It is recommended the PBE pseudopotentials are used for the PW91 functional instead.

- Updated :class:`~ase.calculators.lammpsrun.LAMMPS` to recognize the LAMMPS ``velocity`` command (:mr:`3805`)

Optimizers
----------

- All optimizers (except GPMin) can now work with flat position and gradient arrays.

- Gradients now have the correct sign in the Optimizable API.
  The Optimizable API is still experimental and may change. (:mr:`3908`)

Molecular dynamics
------------------

- The "NPT" thermostat has been renamed to "MelchionnaNPT" for clearer
  comparison with alternatives, and to avoid giving the impression
  that this is a generally recommended default choice for NPT.

  For backward compatibility an :class:`ase.md.npt.NPT` class remains
  in place, which aliases the renamed class at its new location
  :class:`ase.md.melchionna.MelchionnaNPT`.

  The alias is marked as "deprecated" and will be removed in a future
  ASE version.

- New LangevinBAOAB variable-cell Langevin integrator with Leimkhler's BAOAB method

* ASE now requires Python 3.10+.

- Fix deprecated SQL syntax :mr:`3815`.

- Added :meth:`ase.lattice.match_to_lattice` which matches an input cell

  with non-subscriptable iterables when "move_mask" key is present in
  `atoms.arrays` (:mr:`3795`)

- Fix :func:`~ase.io.extxyz.write_extxyz` to ignore constraints other than

  the common definition in, e.g., LAMMPS ``compute rdf`` (:mr:`3921`)

- Fixed :class:`~ase.calculators.lammpsrun.LAMMPS` to be robust against LAMMPS log files with non-ASCII characters (:mr:`3925`)

- Fixed :class:`~ase.calculators.lammpsrun.LAMMPS` to not run the default `fix nve` command when users set `fix` explicitly (:mr:`3805`)

  :class:`~ase.calculators.GenericFileIOCalculator` (:mr:`3736`)

- DFTD3 no longer warns about systems that are neither 3D periodic
  nor 0D, because there is no way to adapt the code that resolves the
  condition warned about.  (:mr:`3740`)

Optimizers
----------

- Logfile and trajectory inputs now accept both string and Path objects.

- **Breaking change:** The :class:`~ase.utils.abc.Optimizable` interface
  now works in terms of arbitrary degrees of freedom rather than
  Cartesian (Nx3) ones.
  Please note that the interface is still considered an internal feature
  and may still change significantly. (:mr:`3732`)

Molecular dynamics
------------------

- Added anisotropic NpT with MTK equations (:mr:`3595`).

- Fixed bug in Nose-Hoover chain thermostat which would inconsistently update extended variables for the thermostat.

  correctly (:mr:`3653`, :mr:`3655`, :mr:`3657`).

- Enable :func:`ase.io.magres.read_magres` to handle cases from CASTEP < 23 where indices and labels are "munged" together if the index exceeds 99. If an index exceeds 999 the situation remains ambiguous and an error will be raised. (:mr:`3530`)

- Fix duplicated transformation (e.g. rotation) of symmetry labels in :func:`~ase.dft.bz.bz_plot` (:mr:`3617`).

- Fixed bug in :class:`io.utils.PlottingVariables` where automatic

---

- Moved Postgres, MariaDB and MySQL backends to separate project:
  https://gitlab.com/ase/ase-db-backends.  Install from PyPI with
  ``pip install ase-db-backends`` (:mr:`3545`).

- **BREAKING** ase.io.orca ``read_orca_output`` now returns Atoms with attached properties.
  ``ase.io.read`` will use this function.
  The previous behaviour (return results dictionary only) is still available from function ``read_orca_outputs``. (:mr:`3599`)

- Added :func:`~ase.io.castep.write_castep_geom` and
  :func:`~ase.io.castep.write_castep_md` (:mr:`3229`)

- Fixed :mod:`ase.data.pubchem` module to convert ``#`` in SMILES to HEX
  ``%23`` for URL (:mr:`3620`).

- :mod:`ase.db`: Unique IDs are now based on UUID rather than pseudorandom numbers that could become equal due to seeding (:mr:`3614`).

Parameters may be passed directly to the calculator as a :class:`ase.calculators.tersoff.TersoffParameters` object, or the Calculator may be constructed from a LAMMPS-style file using its ``from_lammps`` classmethod. (:mr:`3502`)

Optimizers
----------
